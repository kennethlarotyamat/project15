Once you have created a new React project, you can copy your website's content into the project. This includes all of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Break down your website's content into components.
Once you have copied your website's content into the React project, you need to break down the content into components. This means that you need to identify the different parts of your website and create a separate component for each part.
Write code for each component.
Once you have broken down your website's content into components, you need to write code for each component. This code will be responsible for rendering the component and handling any user interactions.
Combine the components into a single application.
Once you have written code for each component, you need to combine the components into a single application. This can be done by importing the components into a main file and then rendering them using the ReactDOM.render() method.
Deploy the application.
Once you have combined the components into a single application, you can deploy the application. This can be done by using a service like Netlify or Heroku.
Here are some additional tips for refactoring your personal website in React:
Use a library like Redux to manage the state of your application.
Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material UI to style your application.
Use a testing framework like Jest to test your application.
Use a continuous integration (CI) service like Travis CI or CircleCI to automatically build and test your application.

DEEP DIVE
Can I use React without a framework? 

Hide Details
You can definitely use React without a framework—that’s how you’d use React for a part of your page. However, if you’re building a new app or a site fully with React, we recommend using a framework.

Here’s why.

Even if you don’t need routing or data fetching at first, you’ll likely want to add some libraries for them. As your JavaScript bundle grows with every new feature, you might have to figure out how to split code for every route individually. As your data fetching needs get more complex, you are likely to encounter server-client network waterfalls that make your app feel very slow. As your audience includes more users with poor network conditions and low-end devices, you might need to generate HTML from your components to display content early—either on the server, or during the build time. Changing your setup to run some of your code on the server or during the build can be very tricky.

These problems are not React-specific. This is why Svelte has SvelteKit, Vue has Nuxt, and so on. To solve these problems on your own, you’ll need to integrate your bundler with your router and with your data fetching library. It’s not hard to get an initial setup working, but there are a lot of subtleties involved in making an app that loads quickly even as it grows over time. You’ll want to send down the minimal amount of app code but do so in a single client–server roundtrip, in parallel with any data required for the page. You’ll likely want the page to be interactive before your JavaScript code even runs, to support progressive enhancement. You may want to generate a folder of fully static HTML files for your marketing pages that can be hosted anywhere and still work with JavaScript disabled. Building these capabilities yourself takes real work.

React frameworks on this page solve problems like these by default, with no extra work from your side. They let you start very lean and then scale your app with your needs. Each React framework has a community, so finding answers to questions and upgrading tooling is easier. Frameworks also give structure to your code, helping you and others retain context and skills between different projects. Conversely, with a custom setup it’s easier to get stuck on unsupported dependency versions, and you’ll essentially end up creating your own framework—albeit one with no community or upgrade path (and if it’s anything like the ones we’ve made in the past, more haphazardly designed).

If you’re still not convinced, or your app has unusual constraints not served well by these frameworks and you’d like to roll your own custom setup, we can’t stop you—go for it! Grab react and react-dom from npm, set up your custom build process with a bundler like Vite or Parcel, and add other tools as you need them for routing, static generation or server-side rendering, and more.

5. Core Concepts in React
Let’s look at some of React’s core concepts which are important to understand before we begin using it in order to fully appreciate why React is so advantageous for frontend development.
Declarative vs Imperative Programming
The imperative paradigm of programming, which is what we’ve been doing with JavaScript so far in this course, requires developers to explicitly define each step of the program – make this change to the DOM, then that change; if the user does this, then make a different DOM update, etc.
Let’s look at a very simple example to help illustrate the difference between imperative and declarative:
Imperative Example:
Imagine you want to change the background color of a div with an ID of “myDiv” to red when a button is clicked. In imperative programming, you would explicitly specify the steps to achieve this:
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
const myDiv = document.getElementById('myDiv');

button.addEventListener('click', function () {
  myDiv.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
});
Declarative Example:
Now let’s look at the same example, implemented in a declarative way with React. In the declarative paradigm, we simply express what we want to achieve without detailing the specific steps. React will then handle the updating the DOM for us:
import { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [bgColor, setBgColor] = useState('');

  const handleClick = () => {
    setBgColor('red');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Change color</button>
      <div id="myDiv" style={{ backgroundColor: bgColor }}>Hello, World!</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

Here, we’re using the useState React hook to manage the background color state (more on hooks and state later). When the button is clicked, the handleClick function updates the background color to red, and React takes care of updating the UI accordingly.
React follows this declarative paradigm, which is one of the reasons it has become so popular among developers. By abstracting away much of the complexity involved in updating the UI, React enables developers to focus on what they want their applications to do, rather than how they should do it.
Virtual DOM
React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model), which is the structure representing the elements on a web page. In traditional web development, manipulating the DOM can be slow and resource-intensive, leading to poor performance and a suboptimal user experience.
Whenever a component’s state changes, React calculates the difference between the current virtual DOM and the new one. Once the differences have been determined, React updates the real DOM with the minimal set of changes required. This approach minimizes the number of DOM manipulations, leading to significant performance improvements.
Reactive Updates
React automatically updates the UI when the application state changes. This is achieved through the use of reactive updates, which efficiently update only the components affected by the state change. When a component’s state or properties (also known as “props”) change, React triggers a re-render of that component and its children, ensuring that the UI is always in sync with the application state.
This reactive approach simplifies the process of managing UI changes in response to data updates. React handles this automatically, allowing developers to focus on implementing the application’s core functionality.
Component-based Architecture
React follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to build complex UIs by breaking them down into reusable, isolated components. Each component is a self-contained unit with its own state and properties, encapsulating the logic and rendering for a specific part of the UI.
This modular approach promotes code reusability and maintainability, making it easier to manage large applications with numerous features and components. By composing an application from smaller, focused components, developers can create highly organized and scalable codebases that are easier to understand and debug.
One-way Data Binding
React enforces a unidirectional data flow (one-way data binding). This means that data flows from parent components to child components, making it easier to track and debug data changes in the application.

4. Single Page Applications (SPAs)
Typically, as you may remember from the explanation of the client-server model in Week One, the way the vast majority of websites used to work is as follows: a user entered a URL in a browser’s address bar, which then made a request to that website’s server. The server, in turn, sent back to the user all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript necessary to display the requested page. If the user clicked a link to go to a different page on that website, another request was sent to the server, which then sent back another HTML document with its associated CSS and JavaScript, and so on.
Single-page applications (SPAs), on the other hand, are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content as the user interacts with the application – including navigating to a new “page.” This approach provides a smoother, more seamless user experience compared to traditional multi-page applications.
There are several advantages to using SPAs:
Improved performance: By reducing the need for full-page refreshes, SPAs can deliver faster, more responsive user experiences.
Simplified deployment and maintenance: With a single HTML file and separate assets (JavaScript, CSS, images), SPAs can be easier to deploy and maintain compared to traditional multi-page applications.
Enhanced user experience: The app-like behavior of SPAs can lead to a more engaging and user-friendly experience, as users can navigate and interact with the application more quickly and smoothly.
However, there are also some challenges associated with SPAs:
SEO: Due to their reliance on JavaScript for rendering content, SPAs can sometimes face issues with search engine optimization (SEO). Modern search engines have improved their ability to index SPAs, but developers still need to take extra precautions to ensure their content is crawlable and indexable.
Initial load time: As SPAs load most of the application resources upfront, the initial load time can be longer compared to traditional multi-page applications. However, once the initial resources are loaded, subsequent interactions are usually much faster.
Browser history management: Since SPAs don’t rely on traditional page navigation, managing browser history and enabling the back button functionality can be more complex. Developers often use client-side routing libraries to handle this aspect of SPAs.
Of course, as React has only grown in popularity over the years, and the number of React developers has exponentially multiplied, there exists a wealth of different solutions within the React ecosystem to help address these challenges (as there are in other SPA frameworks like Angular and Vue). We’ll cover a couple of them later this week – namely, React Router and React’s lazy loading functionality.

...

3. The Birth of React
As web applications continued to evolve, the need for a more efficient and performant solution became apparent – one that could adequately address the challenges of maintaining and scaling large, complex applications with rapidly changing data. This solution emerged at Facebook, of all places!
Facebook’s applications grew, and the engineering team realized that traditional methods for building user interfaces were becoming increasingly inefficient and difficult to manage. To solve this problem, Facebook engineer Jordan Walke began developing React in 2011. After several iterations and improvements, React was eventually open-sourced in 2013, allowing the wider development community to contribute to and utilize the library. Today, React is used by a vast number of companies and developers, making it one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building UIs.
React is primarily used for developing what are known as single-page applications (SPAs), where the user interacts with and navigates through the website without requiring full-page refreshes. We’ll delve deeper into single-page applications shortly. For now, suffice it to say that one of React’s core strengths is its ability to handle rapidly changing data and seamlessly update the UI without causing unnecessary re-rendering or page refreshes. This is particularly useful when building applications that need to display real-time information or have numerous user interactions.

...

2. Evolution of Frontend Development
To better understand the significance of React in modern web development, it’s helpful to examine the evolution of frontend development over the years. Frontend development has come a long way from using only basic vanilla JavaScript to now having a plethora of advanced libraries and frameworks, shaping the way we build applications today.
Vanilla JavaScript
In the early days of web development, developers were limited to using vanilla JavaScript, which refers to plain JavaScript without any additional libraries or frameworks, to interact with the DOM. While this early form of JavaScript allowed for basic interactivity and DOM manipulation, it was very limited in terms of functionality and often required a lot of repetitive code. As web applications became more complex, developers sought more efficient ways to build dynamic user interfaces.
jQuery
jQuery, released in 2006, was a game-changer for frontend development. It provided a simple, powerful API for DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests, all while ensuring cross-browser compatibility. jQuery significantly reduced the amount of code required to perform common tasks and quickly became the go-to library for frontend developers.
Early frontend frameworks
As web applications continued to grow in complexity, developers needed more robust solutions for organizing and structuring their code. In response, libraries like Backbone.js and frameworks like the original Angular.js emerged, offering more sophisticated tools for building web applications.
Backbone.js, released in 2010, introduced a lightweight, flexible structure based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It provided developers with a way to manage application state and encouraged code modularity.
Angular.js, introduced by Google in 2010, took frontend development yet a step further with its two-way data binding, dependency injection, and built-in directives. Angular.js enabled developers to create complex, feature-rich applications with less code and effort than ever before.
