          // The error message you're seeing indicates that there was an issue while trying to push changes to a Git repository. Let's break down the error message:

          // error: RPC failed; HTTP 400: This indicates that the remote procedure call (RPC) failed, and the HTTP status code 400 suggests a bad request.

          // curl 92 HTTP/2 stream 7 was not closed cleanly: CANCEL (err 8): It seems that there was an issue with the HTTP/2 communication during the push operation. The stream 7 was not closed cleanly, and the error code 8 suggests a cancellation.

          // send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet: There was an unexpected disconnect while trying to send pack data. Sideband packets are used for additional information during Git communication.

          // fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly: The connection to the remote repository was unexpectedly terminated.

          // Everything up-to-date: Despite the errors, Git is reporting that everything is up-to-date, which might be misleading or inaccurate due to the issues encountered during the push.

          // Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

          // Check your internet connection to ensure it's stable.
          // Verify that you have the correct permissions to push to the remote repository.
          // Try pushing the changes again with the same command.
          // If the issue persists, you might want to try a different network or check if there are any network/firewall issues.
          // If the problem persists, you may need to investigate further, potentially by examining server logs or contacting the administrator of the Git repository for assistance.
